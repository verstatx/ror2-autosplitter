A WIP Risk of Rain 2 Autosplitter/Load Remover using the livesplit-core
auto-splitting-v2 API. Adapted from the RiskOfRain2.asl.

The `fast-reset-detection` branch detects resets more quickly than the regular
branch. Runners can know when to reset before the first stage fully loads,
which is before the original timer starts, and that causes the reset to be
skipped. This branch works around the problem by starting the timer a little
earlier (identical to previous versions' start timing with the -0.56s offset),
and compensates by pausing at 0:00 until the start condition matches the
original timer's start condition. The downside to this method is that the
"Real Time" of the timer will include the paused time.

Runners will need to manually subtract 0.56s from their "Real time" when
submitting runs using this branch. "Game Time" needs no adjustments.

Compiles to WebAssembly using clang (see build.sh).
Compile-time "#define"s (you have to edit build.sh manually):

 - '-DBAZAAR_SPLIT': enabled by default.
   Split when exiting bazaar.

 - '-DV1_1': disabled by default.
   Changes some pointer paths to target game versions after the Anniversary
   Update.

 - '-DDEBUG_OUTPUT': disabled by default.
   Dumps the internal state to the output log on any state change. Format is
   old scene name, current scene name, old in_game state, current
   in_game state, old stage_count, current stage_count

 - '-DUSE_WASI_SDK': disabled by default.
   Used internally to enable headers included in the WASI SDK. Basically
   useless.


Current limitations:

 - Automatic version detection is not implemented.

 - Does not work for game versions past the SotV update.

 - The upstream ASL script now uses a helper library which this version cannot
   support.

 - If enabled, debug output will rarely crash the autosplitter if the scene
   name happens to be corrupt.
