A WIP Risk of Rain 2 Autosplitter/Load Remover for livesplit-core
adapted from RiskOfRain2.asl.


Compiles to WebAssembly using clang (see build.sh).
Compile-time "#define"s (you have to edit build.sh manually):

 - '-DREMOVE_LOADS': enabled by default.
   Enables the load-removal feature.

 - '-DV1_0_3_1': disabled by default.
   Changes some pointer paths to target game version 1.0.3.1

 - '-DDEBUG_OUTPUT': disabled by default.
   Dumps the internal state to the output log on any state change. Format is
   old scene name, current scene name, old in_game state, current
   in_game state, old stage_count, current stage_count

 - '-DPACKED_STRINGS': enabled by default.
   Changes the way strings are extracted internally. Mostly irrelevant.

 - '-DUSE_WASI_SDK': disabled by default.
   Used internally to enable headers included in the WASI SDK. Basically
   useless.


Current limitations:

 - Automatic version detection is not possible.

 - There is no timer offset on start.

 - Loads can be detected, but this uses the old "load2" variable in an older
   version of the autosplitter.

 - Some pointer paths differ from the upstream ASL script.

 - If enabled, debug output will rarely crash the autosplitter if the scene
   name happens to be corrupt.
