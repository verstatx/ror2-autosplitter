A WIP Risk of Rain 2 Autosplitter/Load Remover using the livesplit-core
auto-splitting-v2 API. Adapted from the RiskOfRain2.asl.

Compiles to WebAssembly using clang (see build.sh).
Compile-time "#define"s (you have to edit build.sh manually):

 - '-DBAZAAR_SPLIT': enabled by default.
   Split when exiting bazaar.

 - '-DV1_1': disabled by default.
   Changes some pointer paths to target game versions after the Anniversary
   Update.

 - '-DDEBUG_OUTPUT': disabled by default.
   Dumps the internal state to the output log on any state change. Format is
   old scene name, current scene name, old in_game state, current
   in_game state, old stage_count, current stage_count

 - '-DUSE_WASI_SDK': disabled by default.
   Used internally to enable headers included in the WASI SDK. Basically
   useless.


Current limitations:

 - Automatic version detection is not implemented.

 - Does not work for game versions past the SotV update.

 - The upstream ASL script now uses a helper library which this version cannot
   support.

 - If enabled, debug output will rarely crash the autosplitter if the scene
   name happens to be corrupt.
